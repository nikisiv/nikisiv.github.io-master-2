  <p>thrivesolo.com is the website for a service for analysing and managing
    freelance projects. It has a simple, clean layout with plain color schemes.
    There are three different dual color combinations across the three major tabs
    in the website. The contrast in the color combination works well and has
    very good readability. The design of the website is such that it clearly
    directs the user and exhibits a clear sense of navigation. The user primarily
    has to just keep scrolling until the bottom of the page to read the entire
    content in the webpage. This way, the user doesn’t have click on adjacent
    links/ choose where to move to. </p>
    <p>I am looking at three different breakpoints for this website: namely,
      desktop screen, iPad and iPhone. When viewed on the desktop screen, the
      website exhibits a clear sense of hierarchy. The navigation bar is always
      fixed at the top no matter how far the user scrolls down. There are bold
      illustrations with few lines of text placed adjacent to each other. This
      layout is successful because it doesn’t make the website look text heavy.
      And, the illustrations add visual interest to the page.</p>
      <p>When viewed on an iPad screen the navigation bar at the header takes
        up two rows of space as opposed to one row when viewed on the website.
        The rest of the content layout is preserved. It works in this case
        because there’s just a big illustration and a small paragraph of text
        next to it. Basically, it is a two-column layout. Therefore, it makes
        it easy to preserve the layout when scaling down. The margin spacing
        between elements is all that is changed in order to scale it down to
        fit an iPad screen. I feel like this is smart because it doesn’t
        involve changing the layout much. It seems very logical to have a
        two-column layout in this case.</p>
        <p>As for viewing the site on an iPhone screen, each element in the
          navigation tab takes up an entire two on its own and the elements are
          stacked one on top of each other. The content is organised in such a
          manner that the small paragraph precedes the illustration and everything
          is again, stacked one on top of each other. Again, this design is smart
          and feels right because it maintains the simplicity of the page while
          having a strong sense of hierarchy. On the whole, I feel like this design
          is amazing across multiple platforms mainly because of its simplicity. </p>
