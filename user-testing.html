  <h2>Article on A List Apart: Never show a design you haven't tested on users</h2>
  <h3>October 22nd, 2016</h3>

  <p>What I learnt about user-testing from this article:<br />
     User testing is the only way to find out if users actually get your design
     or understand as you meant them to understand. It’s the only way to see if
     the design is actually intuitive. User testing helps analyse where you can
     make small improvements to your product: it allows room for innovation.
     It is best explained in the article when the author tried to redesign a
     sign-up form which somewhat seemed already perfect. But user testing
     results revealed that there’s definitely room for improvement and a
     potential design opportunity there. User testing gives focus to stake-holder
     needs. By user testing, you could analyse the user’s thoughts about the
     product, give clarity to your own ideas and explain it to the stakeholder.
     Based on the user’s feedback, you could further iterate and improve the
     product. This is a great way to include stakeholder’s in the design and
     decision making process as it gives them an opportunity to keep giving
     suggestions all along the way. </p>
    <p>Some things I didn’t know before reading the article but got to know after:<br />
      New term I learnt: Pluralistic Walkthrough - wherein the designer puts up
      the screenshot of the code or design on platforms like slack and then shares
      it with fellow colleagues. The colleagues spend a couple of minutes to review
      and give feedback. It is both time saving and cost cutting. I got to know about
      online tools for conducting usability tests. Like, Chalkmark where one could
      get a feel for whether people understand whether something is clickable or not.</p>
      <p>How might the article help me in my design practice: <br /> I realised
        that it is important for me to integrate user testing with all of my
        design projects as it helps develop a better product which directly
        addresses a user’s need. I also figured that user testing needn’t be a
        heavily planned event with a huge investment in time or money. It could
        be as simple as walking up to people on the road with some candy and the
        product to be tested. This article explained quite a handful of interesting
        techniques for user testing that I’d definitely like to adopt going forward.</p>
