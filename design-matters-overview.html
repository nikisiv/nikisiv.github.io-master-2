      <h3>Overview</h3>

      <p>3D printing is based on the process of additive manufacturing where
        the printing is done layer by layer to create a three dimensional object.
        It helps reduce the manufacturing and production cost of producing
        objects using traditional techniques of melding and forging.
        The first step is to create a blueprint of the object that needs to be
        3D printed which can be created using 3D modeling software like Autodesk
        Fusion. Once that is done, it is sent to the printer. Some printers
        like that of the Makerbot have a spool of replaceable plastic attached
        to the back of the device. Once data is sent to the printer, the plastic
        strip is melted and laid out in layers onto a plate where it instantly
        cools down. The printer adds only layer at a time to create a fully
        formed structure of the object.</p>
      <p>There are several advantages to using 3D printing technique. It can
        help create complex designs, customize each and every item in terms of
        size or shape, eliminates the need to use tools, has low fixed cost,
        faster prototyping and creates less waste. However, it also has certain
        disadvantages like a higher cost for large production runs, less material
        choices and colors, limited strength and endurance and finally, lower precision.</p>
      <p>However, it is a fast-growing technology holding a lot of promise for
        the design and manufacturing industry.</p>
