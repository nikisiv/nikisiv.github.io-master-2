        <p>The 3D printing technology is growing by leaps and bounds and a million
        personal 3D printers are expected to be sold by the year 2020. There are
        multiple repositories available online that provides open-source blueprints
        for 3D fabrication. Websites like Thingverse allow 3D printing of
        replacement parts for automobiles and the likes. It has become very
        common for people to get these automobile parts printed for actual use
        and at a comparatively lesser cost.</p>
      <p>Currently, 3D printing has started facilitating a new age of personal
        fabrication where people can get their digital designs 3D printed to form
        actual prototypes at a low cost. This greatly helps at-home inventors
        and designers. This has resulted in an easy entry into the manufacturing
        business without a great deal of investment in stocking or tooling. Websites
        like Shapeways and i.materialise allow people that upload 3D models to
        open an online store and sell products.</p>
      <p>In the year 1989, Scott Crump invented the Fused Deposit Modeling
        technique. This technique has a string of solid material called the
        filament, which is heated by a nozzle. The filament melts and can be
        extruded on a path created by the computer. Once one layer is extruded,
        it cools down and solidifies. The subsequent layers are laid on top of
        each other to create the 3D structure. This is the most common
        technology used for desktop 3D printing and is most suitable for quick,
        low-cost prototyping.</p>
      <p>Currently, 3D cloud printing is gaining prominence where digital files
        uploaded on cloud can be 3D printed anywhere around the world. This has
        removed the geographical constraints for businesses and can also eradicate
        shipping or transportation costs that usually arise when resources are
        shipped across international borders.</p>
      <p>3D printing has potential application across a wide range of fields
        like automotive industries where car replacement parts are printed,
        medicine where doctors print organs to perform tests, dentistry where
        the patientâ€™s jaw is 3D printed to analyze the placement of braces,
        prosthetics where prosthetic hands and limbs are printed and the
        construction industry where houses are printed within a day.</p>
