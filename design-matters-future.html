      <h3>Future</h3>

      <p><span>Localized production for consumer and industrial goods:</span><br /><br />
        3D printing will lead to a localized commercial production where
        people will be able to 3D print almost anything at home including
        various consumer goods. This will make it much more affordable,
        convenient and efficient thereby satisfying household needs.
        It will soon be possible for several digital 3D printing factories
        of different sizes and capacities to be connected in a global production
        network. The capacity to print consumer goods at home will cut down on
        the inventory shipping costs and this might disrupt the supply chain
        drastically.</p>
      <p><span>Custom production materials:</span><br /><br />
        Doctors are currently using the technique of 3D printing to create
        knee replacements for each patient. Soon, they might be able to print
        live tissue and the material might itself contain pain medications and
        antibiotics. 3D printing experiments are underway where Graphene,
        a material 100 times stronger than steel but flexible and transparent,
        is tested. Human cells like the stem cells can be printed into complex
        functional living tissues. 3D bioprinting has the potential to re-shape
        the healthcare industry.</p>
      <p><span>Nano printing:</span><br /><br />
        There exists a 3D printed lithium ion battery that works like a normal
        battery but is the size of a single sand grain. These can be used to
        power miniature robots, compact electronics and tiny medical devices as
        well. 3D Nanoprinting makes rapid prototyping of micro, nano structures
        possible.</p>
      <p><span>Goal directed design:</span><br /><br />
        Unlimited complexity in materials and geometry can be
        achieved in 3D printing. Imagine a computer that automatically
        generates thousands and thousands of variations of a particular
        design until a particular problem is solved. This refers to goal
        directed designing where the designer starts with specific objectives
        for factors like strength, weight and durability. The computer
        would then generate hundreds of design possibilities, evaluating
        and recommending the best designs for specific objectives.</p>
      <p><span>4D printing:</span><br /><br />
        How about printing a 3D object in such a way that at a future point,
        it automatically alters itself or self assembles with change in the
        environment like moisture or temperature. Imagine a construction brick
        that only reaches its full weight and structure after water is added to
        it, at the exact location where it will be used. Envision hydraulic
        pipes that automatically repair themselves if they are ever damaged.
        Get ready to wear sneakers that become running shoes if you started
        running, or grow cleats if you walk on grass, or become waterproof
        if it starts to rain. While this technology is still new, it promises
        to take 3D printing to an entirely new dimension.</p>
