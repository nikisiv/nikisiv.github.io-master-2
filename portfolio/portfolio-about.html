     <p class="aboutpara">I am Nikitaa Sivaakumar, currently a second year MFA student at UC Davis,
       pursuing Product Design. I am particularly interested in developing
       low-cost products because I feel like adding a constraint on cost while
       still making a product fully-functional and aesthetically pleasing is
       challenging. Also, design is commonly perceived as a commodity of the rich.
       Through my works, I would like to challenge this notion and make design
       accessible to everybody. I am currently leaning more towards Human-centered
       design and possess a varied skillset consisting of design thinking,
       rapid prototyping, 3D modelling, 3D printing, laser cutting, HTML,
       CSS, Web Design and the Adobe creative suite.</p>
