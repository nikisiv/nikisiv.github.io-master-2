      <h3>Past</h3>

      <p>3D printing has been around for more than three decades though it is
        commonly thought of as being a futuristic concept. Chuck Hull invented
        the very first 3D printing technique in 1983 and the process is called
        stereolithography. According to this technique, layers of light curable
        liquid are laid one on top of the other to create the 3D form. Later on,
        it was found that any material capable of solidifying or altering its
        physical state can be used for 3D printing and that forms the basis for
        the additive manufacturing that we are aware of, now.</p>
       <p>In the year 1987, Carl Decker invented the Selective Laser Sintering process.
        This technique makes use of laser to melt and solidify layers of powdered
        material into finished objects. In this technique, the first layer is
        printed on powder and is melted using laser. Once it solidifies, the
        bed moves downward and a new layer of powder is spread on top of this
        layer. This technique is mostly used for industrial 3D printing applications.</p>
      <p>In the year 1989, Scott Crump invented the Fused Deposit Modeling
        technique. This technique has a string of solid material called the
        filament, which is heated by a nozzle. The filament melts and can be
        extruded on a path created by the computer. Once one layer is extruded,
        it cools down and solidifies. The subsequent layers are laid on top of
        each other to create the 3D structure. This is the most common
        technology used for desktop 3D printing and is most suitable for quick,
        low-cost prototyping.</p>
      <p>By mid 1990s new technologies for material deposition were invented
        including microcasting and sprayed materials. In the year 2007,
        3D printing started becoming more accessible to a wider audience due
        to the advent of RepRap â€“ concept of an open source self replicating
        3D printer.</p>
      <p>By 2012, alternative 3D printing processes utilizing stereolithography
        started entering the market for a wide audience and mainstream media
        channels picked up on the technology.</p>
