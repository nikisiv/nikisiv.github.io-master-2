  <p>I didn’t have any trouble creating the html file for the Roaster page.
    I made sure to get the indentation right and the code looks much better and
    well organized with the indentation in place. However, I made an error with
    the syntax of the anchor tag wherein I interchanged the ‘=’ and the ‘href’.
    I realized the error when testing the html page to check if it was correctly
    linking to the other page and it obviously, wasn’t. Other than that, there
    were no glitches in getting the html code up and running. </p>
    <p>Another issue I had was with linking the css file to the html version.
      I started with creating a new css file named ‘our-roasters.css’ and tried
      linking it to ‘our-roasters.html’ only to find, much to my disappointment
      that it wasn’t working. I was struggling for about fifteen minutes to see
      if I had made any mistake with naming conventions or the code. And, later
      realized that I am supposed to use one master css file for all html pages.
      Therefore I ended up linking ‘coffee-shop.css’ to ‘our-roasters.html’.</p>
      <p>The one question I have in mind is about linking multiple html files
        with the same css file. What can I do if every page is unique and if
        the one css file can’t cater to the needs of different files. Is there
        any way to use multiple css files?</p>
